A Phishing Website Detection Plugin

## How the plugin works
1. User enters a URL they would like to visit into the address bar.
2. Our plugin will run automatically and decide if the URL entered is a suspicious/phishing website or not.
3. The plugin alerts the USER of its findings allowing the user to decide themselves if they would like to proceed.
