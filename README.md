# phishing_web_ml

A Phishing Website Detection Plugin

## How the plugin works
1. User enters a URL they would like to visit into the address bar.
2. Our plugin will run automatically and decide if the URL entered is a suspicious/phishing website or not.
3. The plugin alerts the USER of its findings allowing the user to decide themselves if they would like to proceed.

## File description
Phishing_Website_Detector.ipynb : makes a phishing website detector using machine learning  
model.joblib : is the final model(detector)  
json_io.py : is the python server that has to be run locally for our extension to work. 


## Setups needed to make this plugin work
### 1. Run python server
a. Install python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed. Creating a virtual environment and running the server on it is recommended (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 

b. The following packages are required: sklearn, joblib, and flask. Go ahead and download them with pip. If you do not know how to download python packages, refer to (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/). 

c. Make sure you have json_io.py and model.joblib in one directory. Run json_io.py by typing this in your terminal/cmd:
	
```
python json_io.py
```
d. Voil√†! You have the local server up and running. If you want to stop it, do `ctrl+c`. 
  
### 2. Load our Phishing Website Detection extension to Chrome
